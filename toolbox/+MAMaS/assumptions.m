function a = assumptions(~)
    % STUB: assumptions function for MATLAB Symbolic Toolbox compatibility
    % This is a no-op stub that always returns empty array
    % 
    % In MATLAB Symbolic Toolbox, assumptions() returns or sets assumptions
    % on symbolic variables. Since Maxima assumes all variables are real by
    % default, this stub simply returns empty to maintain compatibility.
